# AI Hero Assignment - Initial Implementation Plan

## 0. Prerequisites and Setup
- [x] Environment Configuration

  - [x] Set up LangSmith API key and project
  - [x] Configure Supabase connection for database access
  Notes:
  - All required environment variables are configured in .env.example

  - LangSmith project set to "cape-hero-assignment"

- [x] Dependencies Setup
  - [x] Add OpenAI package to project
  - [x] Add LangChain and LangSmith packages
  - [x] Add necessary TypeScript types
  Notes:
  - Using @langchain/openai, @langchain/core, and langsmith
  - All dependencies are installed and working

- [x] Database Preparation
  - [x] Generate seed hero data with varied powers and specialties
  - [x] Ensure proper indexes on powers and metadata columns
  - [x] Add vector embeddings column if needed for semantic search
  Notes:
  - Created 10 sample heroes with diverse powers and specialties
  - Added GIN indexes for powers and metadata
  - Created ai_analyses table for storing AI results
  - Added objectives and metadata columns to tickets table

- [x] Type Definitions
  - [x] Create TypeScript interfaces for AI responses
  - [x] Define shared types between AI and database layers
  - [x] Set up zod schemas for validation
  Notes:
  - Types defined in app/types/ai-hero.ts
  - Using Supabase's built-in type system
  - AI analysis types match database schema

## 1. LangSmith Integration Setup
- [ ] Set up LangSmith project
  - Configure API keys and environment
  - Set up tracing for all LLM calls
  - Create evaluation datasets
  - Define success metrics for:
    - Priority assessment accuracy
    - Objective generation quality
    - Hero matching appropriateness

## 2. Core AI Pipeline Components

### 2.1 Ticket Analysis & Priority Assessment
- [ ] Create LangChain chain for ticket analysis
  - Input: ticket title and description
  - Output: 
    - Assessed priority level ('OMEGA' | 'ALPHA' | 'BETA' | 'GAMMA')
    - Threat analysis summary
    - Required power types
  - LangSmith traces for priority decisions

### 2.2 Objective Generation
- [ ] Implement objective generation chain
  - Input: ticket details and priority assessment
  - Output: 2-5 mission objectives based on complexity
  - Each objective should include:
    - Description
    - Required powers/skills
    - Success criteria
  - LangSmith traces for objective generation

### 2.3 Hero Matching
- [ ] Create hero selection chain
  - Input: 
    - Generated objectives
    - Required powers
    - Hero profiles (powers and bios)
  - Output:
    - Ranked list of suitable heroes
    - Matching rationale for each hero
  - LangSmith traces for hero selection logic

## 3. Integration Points

### 3.1 Database Integration
- [ ] Create functions to:
  - Fetch hero profiles and power lists
  - Update ticket priority
  - Create mission with objectives
  - Assign hero to mission
- [ ] Add database functions for:
  - Storing AI analysis results
  - Tracking AI decision history
  - Caching common power matches

### 3.2 API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement endpoints for:
  - POST /api/tickets/analyze - Analyze and set priority
  - POST /api/missions/generate-objectives - Create mission objectives
  - POST /api/missions/assign-hero - Match and assign hero
- [ ] Add middleware for:
  - Rate limiting AI calls
  - Caching frequent requests
  - Error handling and fallbacks

### 3.3 Error Handling
- [ ] Implement fallback strategies for:
  - AI service unavailability
  - No suitable hero matches
  - Invalid AI responses
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring for:
  - AI response times
  - Match quality metrics
  - Error rates and types

## 4. Testing & Validation

### 4.1 Test Dataset Creation
- [ ] Create test cases for:
  - Various ticket types and complexities
  - Different priority scenarios
  - Diverse hero profiles
  - Expected objective patterns

### 4.2 LangSmith Evaluation
- [ ] Set up evaluation chains for:
  - Priority assessment accuracy
  - Objective completeness and relevance
  - Hero-mission match appropriateness
- [ ] Create feedback datasets from results

## Next Steps

1. Share your existing database schemas for:
   - Hero profiles
   - Tickets
   - Missions
   - Objectives (if exists)

2. Provide sample data for:
   - Hero powers and bios
   - Typical ticket descriptions
   - Expected priority levels

3. Confirm the following details:
   - Priority level definitions and criteria
   - Minimum/maximum number of objectives per mission
   - Any specific hero matching rules or constraints

## Initial MVP Scope

The MVP will focus on a single flow:
1. Accept ticket (title + description)
2. Analyze and set appropriate priority
3. Generate 2-5 relevant objectives
4. Match with most suitable hero
5. Create mission assignmenta

All steps will be traced and evaluated through LangSmith for:
- Decision accuracy
- Response quality
- Processing time
- Success rate 

## Additional Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider caching common AI analyses
   - Implement batch processing for multiple tickets
   - Use streaming responses for long-running operations

2. **Security Considerations**
   - Ensure AI keys are properly secured
   - Implement rate limiting for AI endpoints
   - Add audit logging for AI decisions

3. **Monitoring Requirements**
   - Set up error tracking for AI services
   - Monitor AI response quality
   - Track hero assignment success rates

4. **Integration with Existing Features**
   - Coordinate with real-time notification system
   - Interface with existing mission tracking
   - Integrate with hero availability system
